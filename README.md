## Usage

Once the application is installed, you can run it directly from your terminal.

### Generating Passwords

To generate a password, use the following syntax:

```bash
spwd -L <length> -M <mode>
```

- **`-L <length>`**: The length of the password.
- **`-M <mode>`**: The complexity of the password (choose from `-vw`, `-w`, `-m`, `-s`, `-vs`, `-xb`).

### Example Commands

- **Very Weak (length 8)**:
  ```bash
  spwd -L 8 -M vw
  ```
  This will generate a very weak password of 8 characters, consisting of only digits.

- **Strong (length 16)**:
  ```bash
  spwd -L 16 -M s
  ```
  This will generate a strong password of 16 characters, consisting of numbers, lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and special characters.

- **Unbreakable (length 20)**:
  ```bash
  spwd -L 20 -M xb
  ```
  This will generate an unbreakable password of 20 characters.

### Storing Passwords

- **Store and retrieve stored passwords**:
  ```bash
  spwd -s
  ```
  This will display all stored passwords (decrypted).

- **Delete a stored password by ID**:
  ```bash
  spwd -d [id]
  ```
  This will delete the specified password.

- **Add a note to a stored password**:
  ```bash
  spwd -n [id] "My secure account"
  ```
  This will attach a note to the stored password.

## Clipboard Support

By default, the generated password will be copied to your clipboard after it is created. You can paste it directly into any form or password manager.
